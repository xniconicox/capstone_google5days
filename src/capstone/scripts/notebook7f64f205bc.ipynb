    "  - Provide natural-language search over satellite imagery metadata (Sentinel-2 STAC) using Google ADK.\n",
    "  - Users can specify area, time range, and cloud-cover constraints in free-form text.\n",
    "- High-level summary:\n",
    "  - Resolve AOI (Area of Interest) from place names using a predefined AOI catalog.\n",
    "  - Interpret time range and cloud-cover constraints from text.\n",
    "  - Call a STAC search tool against Sentinel-2 metadata.\n",
